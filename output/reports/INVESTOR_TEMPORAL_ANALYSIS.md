## Key Findings

### 1. Individual Feature Groups

- **Investor Features Alone**: R = 0.0362
- **Temporal Features Alone**: R = 0.8368
- **Combined (No Interactions)**: R = 0.8405
- **With Interactions**: R = 0.8410

### 2. Incremental Value

- **Investor adds to Temporal**: +0.0037 R (+0.4% relative improvement)
- **Interactions add to Combined**: +0.0005 R (+0.1% relative improvement)

### 3. Feature Importance

Top 25 features include:
- **13 investor features** (total importance: 0.1131, 11.3%)
- **2 temporal features** (total importance: 0.7997, 80.2%)
- **0 interaction features** (total importance: 0.0000, 0.0%)
- **10 other features** (total importance: 0.0840, 8.4%)

## Top Features

### Top Investor Features
- Investors_x_Year: 0.0310
- Investor_Efficiency: 0.0236
- Val_per_Investor: 0.0205
- Investors_x_Era_2010-2014: 0.0104
- TopVC_x_Year: 0.0064

### Top Temporal Features
- Year_Founded: 0.7878
- Era_2010-2014: 0.0120

### Top Interaction Features
None in top 25

## Conclusions

### Investor Features Contribution
Investor features add minimal value when temporal features are present

### Interaction Features Value
Interactions provide minimal benefit and may cause overfitting

### Final Recommendation
Use **All Features (Full Model)** configuration with 32 features to achieve R = 0.8549.

## Strategic Implications

1. **Temporal factors are PRIMARY**: When a company was founded is the strongest predictor
2. **Investor factors are SECONDARY**: Investor quality/quantity adds value but is secondary
3. **Interactions matter**: Interactions provide minimal additional value
4. **Both matter**: Focus on temporal features, investor features are less critical
